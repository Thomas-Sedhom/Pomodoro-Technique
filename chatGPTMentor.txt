It looks like the issue is related to Ansible's interaction with the Docker API on your AWS EC2 instance. The error message suggests there's a problem with the connection to the Docker daemon, specifically related to how it handles HTTP requests.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

### 1. **Check Docker Installation**

Ensure Docker is properly installed and running on your EC2 instance. You can SSH into the instance and run:

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

Make sure Docker is active and running. If it's not, you can start it with:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

### 2. **Verify Docker Version Compatibility**

Ensure that the version of the Docker Python SDK (`docker` library) installed on your Ansible control machine is compatible with the Docker version on the EC2 instance. Sometimes version mismatches can cause issues.

You can check the Docker version on the EC2 instance:

```bash
docker --version
```

And ensure that the `docker` Python package on the control machine is up-to-date. You can update it using:

```bash
pip install --upgrade docker
```

### 3. **Check Docker API Compatibility**

The error message `HTTPConnection.request() got an unexpected keyword argument 'chunked'` suggests there might be an issue with how the Docker API is being accessed. This can sometimes happen if the `docker` Python package is outdated or if there's a version mismatch.

Make sure you're using the appropriate version of the Docker Python SDK for the Docker version installed on the server. Sometimes, just updating the Docker Python package can resolve these issues.

### 4. **Verify Ansible Docker Module Configuration**

Ensure that the Ansible `docker_image` and `docker_container` modules are properly configured. The `docker_image` task in your `main.yml` looks correct, but you might need to specify the Docker API version explicitly if there are compatibility issues.

Example:

```yaml
- name: Pull the latest image
  docker_image:
    name: docker.io/thomasrsc/pomd
    tag: latest
    source: pull
    api_version: '1.41'  # Specify the Docker API version if needed
```

### 5. **Debug Ansible Playbook**

You can add verbosity to your Ansible command to get more detailed output, which can help in diagnosing the issue:

```bash
ansible-playbook main.yml -vvvv
```

This might give you more insights into what’s going wrong.

### 6. **Check Ansible Configuration**

Ensure that the `docker` role you’re using is properly configured. If you’re using a third-party role, check the role’s documentation or issues page for compatibility notes.

### 7. **Test Docker Connection Manually**

Try connecting to the Docker daemon manually from the control machine to see if you encounter any issues:

```bash
docker -H tcp://<ec2-instance-ip>:2375 info
```

Replace `<ec2-instance-ip>` with the IP address of your EC2 instance and ensure Docker is exposed on the TCP port (2375 is the default port for Docker remote API).

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with the Docker connection in your Ansible playbook. If you continue to encounter problems, let me know!

so what now


---
It seems like Docker is running fine on your EC2 instance, but there are issues with managing Python packages on your control machine due to its environment constraints.

Here's a step-by-step guide to address the issues and ensure that your Ansible playbook can interact with Docker properly:

### 1. **Addressing the Python Package Issue**

Since you encountered an issue with updating the `docker` Python package due to the "externally-managed-environment," here’s how to work around it:

#### Using a Virtual Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv ~/myenv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   source ~/myenv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the Docker Python SDK Within the Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   pip install docker
   ```

4. **Run Your Ansible Playbook Within the Virtual Environment:**

   Make sure you activate the virtual environment each time you need to run the playbook:

   ```bash
   source ~/myenv/bin/activate
   ansible-playbook main.yml -vvvv
   ```

#### Using Pipx

Alternatively, you can use `pipx` if you prefer:

1. **Install `pipx`:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install pipx
   ```

2. **Install the Docker SDK Using `pipx`:**

   ```bash
   pipx install docker
   ```

### 2. **Check Docker API Version**

Ensure that the Docker API version used by the Ansible `docker` module is compatible with Docker version 25.0.2.

In your Ansible playbook, you can specify the Docker API version if necessary. However, as Docker evolves, specifying an exact version might not always be required unless there are specific compatibility issues.

### 3. **Verify Ansible and Docker Modules Configuration**

Your Ansible playbook’s `docker_image` and `docker_container` tasks look correct, but ensure that Ansible’s Docker modules are compatible with your Docker version.

### 4. **Test Docker Commands Directly**

To ensure that the Docker daemon is working properly, you can run a Docker command directly on your EC2 instance:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

This command pulls the `hello-world` image and runs it in a container to verify that Docker is working as expected.

### 5. **Update Ansible**

Make sure you’re using the latest version of Ansible, as newer versions might have fixes or improvements related to Docker module compatibility:

```bash
pip install --upgrade ansible
```

If you're using Ansible within a virtual environment, you should perform this update within that environment.

### 6. **Review Ansible Output**

Run the Ansible playbook with verbosity to get detailed error information:

```bash
ansible-playbook main.yml -vvvv
```

This output might provide additional clues about what’s going wrong with the Docker module.

By following these steps, you should be able to address the issues with Docker and the Python environment, allowing your Ansible playbook to run successfully. If you encounter further issues or need additional help, feel free to ask!

---
The traceback and error message you're seeing indicate that there's an issue with the way the Ansible Docker module is trying to interact with the Docker API. Specifically, it seems to be a problem with the `chunked` argument used in the `HTTPConnection.request()` call, which is not expected by the Docker Python client or the underlying HTTP library.

Here’s a step-by-step approach to resolve this issue:

### 1. **Verify Docker API Compatibility**

Ensure that the Docker Python client library (`docker` package) is compatible with the version of Docker you have installed. Docker version 25.0.2 should be compatible with most recent versions of the Docker SDK for Python, but double-checking compatibility can help.

### 2. **Check Docker Python Library**

Sometimes, specific versions of the Docker SDK for Python can have issues. Try installing a specific version of the `docker` library that matches your Docker version. 

#### Install a Compatible Version

1. **Create a Virtual Environment** (if not already done):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv ~/myenv
   source ~/myenv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Specific Docker SDK Version:**

   You might need to install a version of the Docker SDK for Python that is known to be compatible. You can specify the version in your `pip` command. For example:

   ```bash
   pip install docker==6.0.1
   ```

   Adjust the version number if necessary. The goal is to try different versions until you find one that works with Docker 25.0.2.

### 3. **Update Ansible Docker Collection**

Ensure that you are using the latest version of the Ansible Docker collection, as it might contain fixes for compatibility issues:

1. **Update Ansible Collections:**

   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy collection install community.docker --upgrade
   ```

2. **Check Your Ansible Configuration:**

   Make sure that your Ansible configuration is correctly pointing to the Docker collection.

### 4. **Test Docker Connectivity**

Check if you can manually connect to the Docker daemon from your Ansible control machine. This will help confirm if the issue is specific to Ansible or a general connectivity issue.

```bash
docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock info
```

This command should provide details about the Docker daemon running on your EC2 instance. If it fails, there might be a problem with Docker's configuration or the socket file.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Ansible Playbook**

Ensure your Ansible playbook is correctly set up and that there are no misconfigurations. Here is an example of a simple Docker task:

```yaml
- name: Pull the latest image
  docker_image:
    name: docker.io/thomasrsc/pomd
    tag: latest
    source: pull

- name: Deploy the app container
  docker_container:
    name: pomodoro
    image: thomasrsc/pomd:latest
    state: started
    ports:
      - "80:8080"
```

### 6. **Increase Ansible Verbosity**

Run the playbook with increased verbosity to get more details:

```bash
ansible-playbook main.yml -vvvv
```

This might provide more insights into what is causing the issue.

### 7. **Reinstall Docker and Docker SDK**

As a last resort, if compatibility issues persist, consider reinstalling Docker and the Docker SDK for Python. Sometimes, a fresh installation can resolve obscure issues.

### Summary

- **Ensure Compatibility:** Check versions of Docker and Docker SDK.
- **Update Ansible Collection:** Use the latest version of the Docker Ansible collection.
- **Test Connectivity:** Verify Docker daemon access and functionality.
- **Review Playbook:** Double-check configurations and settings.
- **Increase Verbosity:** Get more detailed error messages.

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the connection issue with Docker in your Ansible playbook. If the problem persists, please provide any additional error messages or logs, and I can assist further!

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************************************
ec2-54-196-153-254.compute-1.amazonaws.com : ok=8    changed=3    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0   

so what now how can i open my website from my instance


---
Great news! Your Ansible playbook ran successfully, which means Docker and your container should be set up and running. Now, to access your website, you'll need to ensure a few things are correctly configured:

### 1. **Check Docker Container Status**

Ensure that your Docker container is running and properly mapped to the correct ports. You can verify this by SSHing into your EC2 instance and running:

```bash
docker ps
```

This command will list all running containers along with their port mappings. Ensure that your container `pomodoro` is listed and that port 80 on the host is mapped to port 8080 in the container (as specified in your playbook).

### 2. **Check EC2 Security Group Rules**

Ensure that the EC2 instance's security group allows inbound traffic on the port you're using (port 80 in this case). 

1. **Navigate to EC2 Dashboard:**
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and open the EC2 Dashboard.
   
2. **Select Your Instance:**
   - Find your instance in the list and click on it to view its details.

3. **Check Security Group:**
   - Find the "Security groups" section and click on the relevant security group.

4. **Edit Inbound Rules:**
   - Ensure there is a rule allowing inbound traffic on port 80. If not, add a rule to allow HTTP traffic:
     - Type: `HTTP`
     - Protocol: `TCP`
     - Port Range: `80`
     - Source: `0.0.0.0/0` (for public access) or restrict it as needed.

### 3. **Verify Application**

Open a web browser and navigate to your EC2 instance's public IP address:

```
http://<your-ec2-public-ip>
```

Replace `<your-ec2-public-ip>` with the actual public IP address of your EC2 instance. If everything is configured correctly, you should see your application running.

### 4. **Check Docker Container Logs**

If you don’t see your website as expected, check the logs of your Docker container to see if there are any errors:

```bash
docker logs pomodoro
```

This will display the logs from the `pomodoro` container and might provide insight into any issues.

### 5. **DNS Configuration (Optional)**

If you want to use a domain name instead of the public IP address, you'll need to configure DNS settings:

1. **Register a Domain:**
   - Use a domain registrar to purchase a domain if you haven’t already.

2. **Configure DNS Records:**
   - Point your domain to your EC2 instance’s public IP address by setting up an `A` record in your domain registrar's DNS settings.

3. **Update Security Group (if necessary):**
   - Ensure that your security group rules allow traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and/or 443 (HTTPS).

### Summary

1. **Check Docker Container:** Confirm that your container is running and port mappings are correct.
2. **Security Group Rules:** Ensure port 80 is open for inbound traffic.
3. **Access Website:** Visit the EC2 instance's public IP address in a browser.
4. **Review Logs:** Check container logs if the site isn’t displaying as expected.
5. **DNS Configuration (Optional):** Set up DNS if you want to use a domain name.

By following these steps, you should be able to access and view your website hosted on the EC2 instance. If you run into any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

Ensure that your Docker container is running and properly mapped to the correct ports. You can verify this by SSHing into your EC2 instance and running:

how can i make that


---
To ensure that your Docker container is running and properly mapped to the correct ports, follow these steps:

### 1. **SSH into Your EC2 Instance**

1. **Find Your EC2 Instance’s Public IP Address:**
   - Go to the [EC2 Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/) on the AWS Management Console.
   - Locate your EC2 instance and note its public IP address or public DNS.

2. **SSH into the EC2 Instance:**
   - Open a terminal on your local machine.
   - Use the `ssh` command to connect to your EC2 instance. Replace `<your-key-pair>` with your SSH key file (e.g., `my-key.pem`), and `<ec2-public-ip>` with your EC2 instance’s public IP address or DNS.

   ```bash
   ssh -i <your-key-pair> ec2-user@<ec2-public-ip>
   ```

   For Ubuntu instances, use `ubuntu` instead of `ec2-user`:

   ```bash
   ssh -i <your-key-pair> ubuntu@<ec2-public-ip>
   ```

### 2. **Check Running Docker Containers**

Once you're logged into the EC2 instance, check the status of your Docker containers by running:

```bash
docker ps
```

This command will display a list of running containers. Look for your container named `pomodoro` (or whatever name you assigned to it). The output should include information about:

- **Container ID**
- **Image** being used
- **Command** run in the container
- **Ports** mapped from the container to the host
- **Status** of the container

#### Example Output

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                  NAMES
abcdef123456   thomasrsc/pomd:latest "/start-command"         5 minutes ago    Up 5 minutes    0.0.0.0:80->8080/tcp   pomodoro
```

In this example, `0.0.0.0:80->8080/tcp` indicates that port 80 on the host is mapped to port 8080 in the container.

### 3. **Verify Port Mapping**

Ensure that your container’s ports are correctly mapped. The `PORTS` column in the `docker ps` output shows how the container’s internal port is mapped to the host machine’s port.

- **Host Port:** The port on the EC2 instance (e.g., 80).
- **Container Port:** The port inside the container (e.g., 8080).

### 4. **Test Application Inside Container**

If you need to further verify that the application inside the container is running correctly, you can execute commands within the container:

1. **Get a Shell Inside the Container:**

   ```bash
   docker exec -it pomodoro /bin/bash
   ```

   Replace `pomodoro` with the name or ID of your container. If `/bin/bash` doesn’t work, you might try `/bin/sh` instead.

2. **Check Application Status:**

   Inside the container, check if your application is running. For example, if your application starts with a specific command or if there are log files you can inspect.

### 5. **Check Logs**

If there are issues with the container, the logs might provide more details:

```bash
docker logs pomodoro
```

This command will show the logs of the `pomodoro` container, which can help diagnose issues with your application.

### Summary

1. **SSH into EC2 Instance:** Use `ssh` to access your EC2 instance.
2. **Check Docker Containers:** Run `docker ps` to list running containers and verify port mappings.
3. **Verify Port Mapping:** Ensure the container’s internal port is correctly mapped to the host’s port.
4. **Test Application:** Optionally, access the container’s shell and check application status.
5. **Review Logs:** Use `docker logs` to inspect container logs for troubleshooting.

By following these steps, you should be able to verify that your Docker container is running and configured correctly. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, let me know!

permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.46/containers/json": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied


---
The "permission denied" error when trying to run `docker ps` indicates that your user does not have the necessary permissions to access the Docker daemon. This is a common issue that occurs if Docker is not configured to allow non-root users to interact with it.

Here's how you can resolve this issue:

### 1. **Add Your User to the Docker Group**

Docker commands typically require root privileges, but you can allow non-root users to run Docker commands by adding them to the Docker group.

1. **Add the `ubuntu` User to the Docker Group:**

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
   ```

   This command adds the `ubuntu` user (or whichever user you're logged in as) to the `docker` group. Note that `${USER}` automatically expands to your username.

2. **Apply Group Changes:**

   After running the above command, you need to either log out and log back in or start a new shell session to apply the group changes.

   To avoid logging out, you can run:

   ```bash
   newgrp docker
   ```

   This command activates the Docker group in the current session.

### 2. **Verify Docker Permissions**

After adding the user to the Docker group and applying the group changes, verify that you can now run Docker commands:

```bash
docker ps
```

This should now work without the "permission denied" error.

### 3. **Check Docker Service Status**

Ensure that the Docker service is running correctly:

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

If Docker is not running, you can start it with:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

### 4. **Troubleshoot Further**

If you still encounter issues after adding your user to the Docker group, you might need to check Docker's socket permissions:

1. **Check Docker Socket Permissions:**

   ```bash
   ls -l /var/run/docker.sock
   ```

   The output should show that the socket is owned by the `docker` group. For example:

   ```

so what now to open my website


---
Your Docker container is up and running, and it is correctly mapped to port 80 on the host. This means your application should be accessible via the public IP address of your EC2 instance.

### Steps to Access Your Website

1. **Check the EC2 Security Group Rules**

   Ensure that the EC2 instance's security group allows inbound traffic on port 80. If port 80 is not open, you won’t be able to access your website from the internet.

   Here's how you can check and update the security group rules:

   1. **Go to the AWS Management Console** and navigate to the [EC2 Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).
   2. **Find Your Instance** in the list and click on it to view its details.
   3. **Click on the Security Groups** link associated with your instance.
   4. **Edit Inbound Rules**:
      - Click on the "Inbound rules" tab.
      - Ensure there is a rule allowing HTTP traffic:
        - **Type:** HTTP
        - **Protocol:** TCP
        - **Port Range:** 80
        - **Source:** 0.0.0.0/0 (to allow all IP addresses) or restrict it to specific IPs if needed.
   5. **Save the Changes**.

2. **Access Your Website**

   Open a web browser and enter the public IP address of your EC2 instance:

   ```
   http://<your-ec2-public-ip>
   ```

   Replace `<your-ec2-public-ip>` with the actual public IP address of your EC2 instance.

   If everything is set up correctly, you should see your application running.

3. **Verify Docker Container Ports**

   You already verified that Docker is mapping port 80 on the host to port 8080 in the container, which is correct. The `docker ps` output shows this mapping as `0.0.0.0:80->8080/tcp`.

4. **Check Application Logs (if needed)**

   If you don’t see your website, check the logs of your Docker container to ensure the application is running correctly:

   ```bash
   docker logs pomodoro
   ```

   Look for any errors or issues that might indicate why the application is not accessible.

### Summary

1. **Check Security Group Rules:** Ensure port 80 is open for inbound traffic.
2. **Open Browser and Test:** Navigate to `http://<your-ec2-public-ip>`.
3. **Check Docker Container Logs:** Review logs if the site isn’t accessible.

By following these steps, you should be able to access your website hosted on the EC2 instance. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please let me know!

1. **Verify Security Group Rules:**
   - Go to the [EC2 Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/) on AWS Management Console.
   - Locate your instance and check its associated security group.
   - Ensure there is an inbound rule that allows traffic on port 80.

   **Example Rule:**
   - **Type:** HTTP
   - **Protocol:** TCP
   - **Port Range:** 80
   - **Source:** 0.0.0.0/0 (to allow all IP addresses) or restrict it as needed.

2. **Update Security Group Rules (if needed):**
   - If port 80 is not open, add a rule to allow HTTP traffic.
   - Save the changes and wait a few moments for them to take effect.

### 2. **Verify Docker Container Port Mapping**

1. **SSH into Your EC2 Instance:**

   ```bash
   ssh -i "myley.pem" ubuntu@ec2-54-196-153-254.compute-1.amazonaws.com
   ```

2. **Check Docker Container Status:**

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

   Verify that the container is running and port 80 on the host is mapped to port 8080 in the container. The output should show something like `0.0.0.0:80->8080/tcp`.

3. **Test Container Connectivity:**

   Check if the application inside the container is running and accessible. Run:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it pomodoro curl http://localhost:8080
   ```

   Replace `pomodoro` with your container name. This should give you a response from the application if it is running correctly.

### 3. **Check Docker Daemon and Container Logs**

1. **Check Docker Daemon Status:**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status docker
   ```

   Ensure Docker is running without issues.

2. **Check Container Logs:**

   ```bash
   docker logs pomodoro
   ```

   Look for any errors or messages that might indicate issues with the application or the container.

### 4. **Check Network and Firewall**

1. **Verify Network Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the EC2 instance has a public IP address and that it's correctly associated with your instance.

2. **Check Instance Reachability:**
   - You can use tools like `telnet` or `nc` to test connectivity to port 80 on your EC2 instance:

     ```bash
     telnet <your-ec2-public-ip> 80
     ```

   - If the connection is refused or times out, this indicates that the port may not be open or there may be network issues.

### 5. **Restart Docker Container**

Sometimes, restarting the Docker container can resolve issues:

```bash
docker restart pomodoro
```

### 6. **Check Application Binding**

Ensure that your application inside the container is correctly binding to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) and not just `localhost`. If your application is only binding to `localhost`, it won’t be accessible from outside the container.

### Summary

1. **Verify Security Group Rules:** Ensure port 80 is open.
2. **Check Docker Configuration:** Confirm port mappings and container status.
3. **Review Logs:** Check Docker and container logs for errors.
4. **Test Network Connectivity:** Use tools like `telnet` to test port accessibility.
5. **Restart Container:** Sometimes a restart can fix issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue preventing access to your website. If you continue to have trouble, please provide any additional error messages or observations for further assistance.

It looks like all your Docker containers have exited and are not currently running. To get your application running again, you'll need to start a new container or troubleshoot why your previous containers exited. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve this:

### 1. **Start a New Container**

1. **Remove Existing Containers:**

   Since the existing containers are not running and seem outdated, you might want to remove them:

   ```bash
   docker rm 5cf3069fd3f5 63e8aaf76882 a767667f4446 7dbef3eeb7d8 0d0a4fc54fe8 8329dd45d390
   ```

   This command removes the stopped containers. Ensure you’re comfortable removing these containers and have the correct ones identified.

2. **Run a New Container:**

   Start a new container with the correct image and port mapping. Ensure you’re using the latest image and configurations:

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name pomodoro -p 80:8080 thomasrsc/pomodoro
   ```

   This command:
   - **`-d`**: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
   - **`--name pomodoro`**: Names the container `pomodoro`.
   - **`-p 80:8080`**: Maps port 80 on the host to port 8080 in the container.
   - **`thomasrsc/pomodoro`**: Specifies the image to use.

### 2. **Check Container Logs**

1. **View Logs:**

   After starting the container, check its logs to ensure there are no errors:

   ```bash
   docker logs pomodoro
   ```

   Look for any error messages that might indicate issues with the application startup.

1. **Access the Container:**

   Once the container is running, you can access it to ensure the application is functioning:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it pomodoro /bin/bash
   ```

2. **Check Application:**

   Inside the container, you can check if the application is listening on port `8080`:

   ```bash
   netstat -tuln | grep 8080
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   ss -tuln | grep 8080
   ```

   Use `curl` to test if the application responds:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080
   ```

### 4. **Review Dockerfile and Application Code**

If the container is still exiting immediately, there may be an issue with your application or Dockerfile. Review your `Dockerfile` and application code for any potential issues. Common issues include:

- **Incorrect Application Bindings:** Ensure the application inside the container binds to `0.0.0.0` rather than `localhost`.
- **Configuration Issues:** Verify that any required environment variables or configuration files are correctly set.

### 5. **Update Docker Image (if needed)**

1. **Pull Latest Image:**

   Ensure you are using the latest image. If necessary, pull the latest version of the image:

   ```bash
   docker pull thomasrsc/pomodoro
   ```

2. **Rebuild Image:**

   If you have local changes or want to rebuild the image, ensure your Dockerfile is correct and rebuild the image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t thomasrsc/pomodoro .
   ```

### Summary

1. **Remove Old Containers:** Use `docker rm` to clean up stopped containers.
2. **Start New Container:** Run a new container with `docker run`.
3. **Check Logs:** View container logs with `docker logs`.

 It looks like your Flask application inside the Docker container is running and listening on port `5000` inside the container. However, you have mapped port `80` on the host to port `8080` in the container. It appears there's a mismatch in the port that the application is listening on and the port exposed by Docker.

Here's how you can fix this:

### 1. **Update Docker Container Port Mapping**

Your Flask application is listening on port `5000` inside the container, but you've mapped port `80` on the host to port `8080` in the container. To align the Flask application's port with the container's exposed port, you should either:

- **Update the Docker Container to Map Port `5000` on the Host to Port `5000` in the Container**

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name pomodoro -p 80:5000 thomasrsc/pomodoro
   ```

   This command maps port `80` on the host to port `5000` in the container, which is the port your Flask app is listening on.

- **Modify the Flask Application to Listen on Port `8080`**

   Alternatively, you can update your Flask application configuration to listen on port `8080`:

   In your `main.py`, change the port to `8080`:

   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080, debug=True)
   ```

   Then, rebuild your Docker image and run the container again with the original port mapping:

   ```bash
   docker build -t thomasrsc/pomodoro .
   docker run -d --name pomodoro -p 80:8080 thomasrsc/pomodoro
   ```

### 2. **Verify Changes**

1. **Check Container Status and Ports:**

   Ensure the container is running and ports are mapped correctly:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

   You should see `0.0.0.0:80->5000/tcp` (if you used the `-p 80:5000` mapping) or `0.0.0.0:80->8080/tcp` (if you updated the Flask app to use port `8080`).

2. **Access the Application:**

   Try accessing your application from a web browser using your EC2 instance’s public IP address:

   ```
   http://<your-ec2-public-ip>
   ```

3. **Check Logs:**

   Review the logs to ensure no errors:

   ```bash
   docker logs pomodoro
   ```

### 3. **Check Security Group Rules**

Ensure your EC2 instance's security group allows inbound traffic on port `80`:

1. **Go to the [EC2 Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).**
2. **Select your instance and check its security group.**
3. **Ensure there is an inbound rule for HTTP (port `80`).**

### 4. **Verify Networking**

Ensure that your EC2 instance is accessible from the internet and that there are no network issues blocking port `80`.

### Summary

1. **Update Port Mapping:** Adjust Docker port mapping to match the Flask application port.
2. **Verify Container:** Check container status and ensure correct port mapping.
3. **Access Application:** Test access via your EC2 instance’s public IP.
4. **Check Security Group and Networking:** Ensure there are no firewall rules or network issues blocking traffic.

By following these steps, you should be able to get your Flask application accessible via port `80` on your EC2 instance. If you encounter further issues, please provide details so I can assist further!
